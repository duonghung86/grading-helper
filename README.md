# Grading helper

This repository is to help us add score at the end of the name of graded files.

Install the packages in the `requirements.txt` file and then run `GpGUI.py`

## Notes about Grading Helper
-	It will take from 30 sec to 1 min start the program.
-	It only works if you graded with **red** color and at the **top right** corner of the first page.
-	The maximum number of files in the folder should be less or equal than 100.
-	If you spot any errors or have any comments, please tell me via Teams or 
     email (`thduong0811@gmail.com`). Thank you in advance. 

## How to use Grading Helper
1.	Choose the folder that you graded by click the button on top. The below pic shows before and after selecting
2.	Check the accuracy of the program manually. If it wrong please, edit it in the number in the Prediction column. 
3.	After verifying all scores, click the bottom button to rename all files (remove long path and add grade at the end). For now, the name in the New Name column will not change after you edit the box, but donâ€™t worry because it still changes when renaming
